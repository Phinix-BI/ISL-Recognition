I need to prioritize sentences, and only break down to words when a sentence or part of a sentence isn't found.  I also need to handle multiple sentences correctly, processing each one separately.\n\nLet me demonstrate the correct approach with the example:  \"i am feeling bored and i am hungry. i am tired like water. who are you?\"\n\n1. **\"i am feeling bored\"**: Matches `sentence_034`.\n2. **\"and\"**:  No sentence match. Break down to word: Not in word list. Ignore articles or break down to characters as a last result. In this particular dataset, it's best to ignore the word “and”. Consider enhancing the provided dataset with these small but crucial words, it is very importent part of sentece for generating proper meaning.\n3. **\"i am hungry\"**: Matches `sentence_037`.\n4. **\"i am tired like water\"**: No sentence match. Best effort:  `sentence_044` (i am tired) + `word_029` (like) + `word_046` (water).\n5. **\"who are you\"**: Matches `sentence_092`\n\nSo the corrected JSON output would be:\n\n```json\n[\"sentence_034\", \"sentence_037\", \"sentence_044\", \"word_029\", \"word_046\", \"sentence_092\"]\n```\n"},

Return the associated sentence identifier if a perfect match is found.\n\n2. **Partial Sentence Matching:** If a full sentence match isn't found, attempt to match *parts* of the sentence against the dataset.  For example, \"I am very happy today\" could partially match \"I am very happy.\"\n\n3. **Word-Level Matching:** If no full or partial sentence matches are found, break down the sentence into individual words and match those against the provided word dataset.\n\n4. **Letter/Number Matching (Last Resort):** Only if a word isn't found in the dataset should you decompose names or numbers into their constituent letters or digits, using the letters and numbers dataset.\n\n5. **Sentence Boundary Detection:**  Correctly identify sentence boundaries (periods, question marks, exclamation marks). Process each sentence *independently*. Do not combine words from different sentences.\n\n6. **Ignore Articles and Certain Conjunctions**: You might want to add an instruction to ignore common connecting words like \"and,\" \"the,\" \"a,\" etc. during word matching if they disrupt the animation sequences or if they aren't found in the dataset unless such word significantly contribute meaning to the sentence.\n\n7. **Combine Results:**  Combine the sentence identifiers, word identifiers, and letter/number identifiers into a final ordered list, reflecting the input order.\n\n8. **Special Case for Names and Numbers:** For words identified as names or numbers but not available in the dataset, handle them in the following way:\n     - Names:  Preferably spell them using the letter animations.  Consider having a dedicated animation for entire names, especially common ones.\n     - Numbers:  Always treat them digit by digit, generating animation for each one from the numbers dataset.\n\n9. **Grammar/Spelling Correction**: Encourage the system to correct obvious spelling and grammatical errors in sentences before matching against datasets.\n\n10. **Strive for Coherence**: Ensure the generated animation sequences create the most coherent and understandable representation of the input text, even when needing to use a mix of animations derived from sentences, words, and letters/numbers.\n\n\nBy incorporating these guidelines, you should receive the expected, correctly segmented output, and the results will focus on using complete sentences whenever available.\n"},

If found, return the associated animation sequence identifier.\n     - If no exact match, attempt **partial sentence matching**, looking for the longest matching subsequence within the dataset.\n\n3. **Word-Level Matching:**\n   - If no sentence-level match (full or partial) is found, split the sentence into individual words.\n   - For each word:\n     - Attempt an exact match against the word dataset. If found, return the associated animation sequence identifier.\n     - If a word is not matched, check for similar words in the dataset to create semantically close animation, this should happen if possible and generate good coherent animations. \n\n4. **Character/Digit Decomposition (Last Resort):**\n   - If a word is not found in the word dataset:\n     - If the word is a name (e.g., \"Biswajit\") or a recognizable entity:\n         - Attempt to use a similar word based on available animation in the dataset.\n         - If unable to use an available animation, decompose it into individual letters and return the animation identifiers from the letters dataset.\n     - If the word is a number: decompose it into individual digits and return animation sequence from the numbers dataset.\n   - Ignore articles (e.g., \"a,\" \"the\") and conjunctions (e.g., \"and,\" \"but\") unless essential for maintaining the coherence or meaning of a generated animation sequence.\n\n5. **Animation Sequence Construction:**\n   - Combine all retrieved animation identifiers (from sentences, words, letters, and digits) into a single, ordered list.  Maintain the original input order.\n   - Prioritize sentence-level matches, then partial sentences, then words and finally, character/digit level animations. The goal is to utilize the longest matching sequence to make the animation most coherent and intuitive.\n\n6. **Similarity Matching (Enhancement):**\n   - If no exact or partial matches are found at the sentence or word level, implement a similarity check (using a suitable metric) to identify sentences or words in the dataset that are semantically close to the input. Use the animation sequence of the closest match if a sufficient degree of similarity is found.  This will ensure the output generates animations are as close as possible to the given text meaning and also maintain animation flow by combining smaller sequences and letter to produce an overall sequence that properly aligns with the original sentence.  However care should be taken to use such approach if a sufficiently close enough match exists or if using such partially matched sequences enhances meaning of the input over completely generating animations based on individual characters and the dataset provides semantically close animation.\n\n7. **Output:**\n   - Return the final ordered list of animation identifiers. This list represents the animation sequence that corresponds to the input text.\n\n\nThis refined instruction set explicitly emphasizes the matching priority (sentences > partial sentences>words > letters/digits), clarifies the handling of names and numbers, introduces the concept of similarity matching, and underscores the importance of generating a coherent and understandable final animation sequence.  It also better accounts for partial sentences matches over completely going for words approach for partial parts.  It also emphasizes to consider ignoring articles/conjunctions unless those enhances meaning when generating animation.\n"},

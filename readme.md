# SanketBani - A ISL SignLanguage based app

# SanketBani

SanketBani is an innovative application designed to bridge the communication gap between the hearing and speech-impaired communities and those who can hear and speak. It leverages advanced AI and 3D technology to convert text, images, and real-time gestures into Indian Sign Language (ISL) gestures, fostering seamless communication and understanding.

## Features

### 1. **Text-to-ISL Conversion**

- Converts any input text into 3D animated Indian Sign Language gestures.
- Allows users to type or paste text and view the corresponding ISL gestures in real-time.

### 2. **Image-to-ISL Conversion**

- Recognizes text from images and converts it into ISL gestures.
- Uses advanced Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and AI models to extract and process text from images.

### 3. **Real-Time Gesture Conversations**

- Facilitates real-time conversations between individuals who can and cannot hear or speak.
- Provides smooth interaction using gesture recognition and 3D animated ISL responses.

### 4. **Gesture-to-Text Conversion**

- Converts sign language gestures from videos into readable text.
- Enables understanding of ISL gestures by those who are unfamiliar with sign language.

### 5. **Custom Dataset**

- Incorporates a structured dataset of ISL gestures, including alphabets, numbers, common sentences, and frequently used words.
- Expands functionality by combining gestures for new or uncommon phrases.

## Technology Stack

### 1. **Frontend**

- **React Native** for the mobile application.
- **Three.js** for rendering 3D models.
- **Expo Go** for development and testing.

### 2. **Backend**

- **Node.js** for API handling.
- APIs for OCR, text-to-sign gesture generation, and other AI functionalities.

### 3. **Recognition Model**

- Python-based video recognition model.
- **TensorFlow** or similar frameworks for gesture-to-text conversion.

## Folder Structure and Setup

The SanketBani project consists of three main folders:

### 1. **Frontend**

- Contains the React Native application.
- Guides for setup:
  ```bash
  cd frontend
  npm install
  ```
- For the first build, run:
  ```bash
  npm run android
  ```
- For subsequent runs:
  ```bash
  npm run start
  ```

### 2. **Backend**

- Contains the Node.js server for handling APIs and other backend functionalities.
- Guides for setup:
  ```bash
  cd backend
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```

### 3. **Recognition Model**

- Contains the Python-based model for video gesture recognition.
- Guides for setup:
  ```bash
  cd recognition
  cd videorecognition
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  python app.py
  ```

## Environment Variables

To ensure proper functioning, create `.env` files in both the frontend and backend folders with the following structure:

### Frontend `.env` Example
```
API_URL=https://example.com/api
```

### Backend `.env` Example
```
PORT=5000
DATABASE_URL=mongodb+srv://user:password@cluster.example.mongodb.net/dbname
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

## How It Works

### Input Processing

1. User provides input via text, image, or gestures.
2. Text is processed to correct grammar and spelling.
3. If the input matches the dataset, a sequence for ISL gestures is generated.
4. For new inputs, the AI combines existing gestures or generates a new sequence.

### Output Rendering

- Processed input is converted into a series of prebuilt 3D animations.
- Animations are displayed in the appâ€™s 3D viewer for users to follow or understand.

## Use Cases

- **Education:** Helps students learn Indian Sign Language in an interactive way.
- **Accessibility:** Enables hearing and speech-impaired individuals to communicate with those who do not know sign language.
- **Translation:** Acts as a translator for conversations between different communities.
- **Awareness:** Promotes ISL adoption and awareness in workplaces, schools, and public spaces.

---

## Challenges Solved

- **Communication Barriers:** Reduces the gap between communities with and without knowledge of ISL.
- **Resource Scarcity:** Provides prebuilt animations for over 285+ gestures, including alphabets, numbers, and common phrases.
- **Ease of Use:** User-friendly interface for inputting and viewing ISL gestures in various formats.
